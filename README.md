# urbansounds2025

In this repo you will find the new script for the urban sounds sensor we have developed with Sensemakers. This script is the 3rd version. 

## How to start
Clone the repo and run on your machine. This script is made for a Raspberry Pi, but it will also run on other hardware. (Except for the cpu_temp function this will raise an exception). 

Create a virtual environment.

Install the packages with 
`pip install requirements.txt`

Run the script `urban_sounds_v3.5.py`
